# Exercise 04: Generate CustomerSelector Component

**Goal:** Create a container component using spec-driven development workflow

**Your task** (20 minutes):

1. **Generate spec**:

   ```
   Write a CustomerSelector spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/customer-selector.md
   ```

2. **Validate spec** - Review for completeness, especially CustomerCard integration and state management

3. **Implement component**:

   ```
   Implement CustomerSelector using @data/mock-customers.ts and @specs/customer-selector-spec.md
   ```

4. **Test and iterate** - Verify search/filter functionality and customer domain display work correctly

5. **Final verification** - Ensure component works with all mock customer data including domain information

**Success criteria:** Working CustomerSelector component generated from a validated specification that properly integrates with CustomerCard
