# Exercise 02c: Add Code Quality to Platform Context

**Goal:** Use Claude to enhance platform constraints with code quality standards

**Your task** (5 minutes):

1. **Configure platform**:

   ```
   Add code quality requirements from @requirements/code-quality.md to CLAUDE.md Platform Constraints
   ```

2. **Validate changes** - Review the updated CLAUDE.md to ensure quality standards are properly integrated

3. **Test constraints**:

   ```
   Create a simple loading button component
   ```

4. **Verify behavior** - Confirm Claude includes descriptive names, TypeScript interfaces, JSDoc comments, and error handling

**Success criteria:** Updated platform context that automatically generates higher-quality code with better patterns
