**Your task** (5 minutes):
1. **Configure platform**: Prompt Claude with "Add code quality requirements from @requirements/code-quality.md to CLAUDE.md Platform Constraints"
2. **Validate changes** - Review the updated CLAUDE.md to ensure quality standards are properly integrated
3. **Test constraints**: Ask Claude to "create a simple loading button component"
4. **Verify behavior** - Confirm Claude includes descriptive names, TypeScript interfaces, JSDoc comments, and error handling
