2. **Add tech context**: Add `/memory Workshop uses Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS`
3. **Validate memory**: Check that Claude retained the information with a simple query
4. **Test behavior**: Ask Claude to "Create a simple spec and save it appropriately" - verify correct location
