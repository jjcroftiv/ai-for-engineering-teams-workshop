# Exercise 01: Prompt Claude for Your First Spec

**Goal:** Use Claude to create a clear, testable specification for CustomerSelector component

**Your task** (10 minutes):
1. **Prompt Claude** with: "Write a CustomerSelector spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/customer-selector.md"
2. **Review the output** - does it match the template structure?
3. **Iterate and refine** - ask Claude to be more specific where needed
4. **Compare** your result with the sample spec on the previous slide

**Success criteria:** Claude generates a specification that clearly defines the CustomerSelector interface and behavior, ready for implementation
