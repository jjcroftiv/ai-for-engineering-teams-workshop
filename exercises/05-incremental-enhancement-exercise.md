# Exercise 05: Incremental Feature Enhancement

**Goal:** Use incremental loops to enhance CustomerCard with selection state using spec-driven development

**Your task** (15 minutes):

1. **Generate enhancement spec**:

   ```
   Write a CustomerCard enhancement spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/customer-card-enhancement.md
   ```

2. **Validate spec** - Review the specification for incremental approach and clear acceptance criteria

3. **Implement Loop 1**: Add click handling to existing CustomerCard component

4. **Implement Loop 2**: Add visual selection state (border/background changes)

5. **Test and verify** - Ensure only one card selected at a time with proper visual feedback

**Success criteria:** Enhanced CustomerCard with working selection state that follows incremental development principles
