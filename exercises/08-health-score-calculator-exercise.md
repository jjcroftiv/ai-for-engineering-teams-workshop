# Exercise 08: Health Score Calculator with AI Collaboration

**Goal:** Create a complete health scoring system through collaborative algorithm development

**Your task** (20 minutes):

## Phase 1: Discovery & Design (8 minutes)

1. **Generate spec**:
   ```
   Create spec using @templates/spec-template.md and @requirements/health-score-calculator.md
   ```

2. **Explore requirements**: Discuss health score factors and weighting collaboratively

3. **Design algorithm**: Work with Claude to design calculation approach

4. **Request explanations**: Have Claude explain algorithm decisions and reasoning

## Phase 2: Development & Validation (12 minutes)

5. **Implement functions**: Request pure function implementation with TypeScript

6. **Generate tests**: Ask for unit tests covering edge cases and validation

7. **Create UI component**: Build CustomerHealthDisplay following dashboard patterns

8. **Test scenarios**: Validate with realistic customer data and edge cases

**Success criteria:** Working health score calculator with explainable algorithms and tests
