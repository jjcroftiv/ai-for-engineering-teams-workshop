# Market Intelligence Widget Requirements

## Business Context

- Build a market intelligence widget for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard
- Provide real-time market sentiment and news analysis for customer companies
- Demonstrate spec-driven context compression and component composition techniques
- Show how to maintain consistency across multiple AI-generated widgets

## Functional Requirements

### API Layer

- Create Next.js API route at `/api/market-intelligence/[company]`
- Use mock data generation for reliable workshop demonstration
- Validate company name input and sanitize responses
- Return consistent JSON response format with sentiment, news count, and headlines
- Follow same patterns as existing customer management API routes
- Include realistic API delay simulation for authentic user experience

### Service Layer

- Create MarketIntelligenceService class following established patterns
- Implement caching with TTL expiration (10-minute cache for mock news data)
- Centralized error handling with custom MarketIntelligenceError class
- Pure function implementations for testability and consistency
- Mock data service generates realistic company-specific headlines and sentiment

### UI Component

- Build MarketIntelligenceWidget component matching existing widget patterns
- Input field for company name entry with validation
- Display market sentiment with color-coded indicators (green/yellow/red)
- Show news article count and last updated timestamp
- Display top 3 headlines with source and publication date
- Loading and error states consistent with other widgets

### Dashboard Integration

- Integrate into main Dashboard component alongside existing widgets
- Receive company name from selected customer data
- Follow same prop passing and state management patterns
- Maintain responsive grid layout and consistent spacing

## Spec-Driven Workflow Requirements

- Generate comprehensive spec using @templates/spec-template.md
- Analyze existing components for pattern consistency before spec creation
- Store generated spec in @specs/ directory for reference
- Reference existing component patterns in spec constraints section

## Security Requirements

- Company name parameter validation to prevent injection attacks
- Input sanitization for mock data generation security
- Proper timeout simulation and error handling
- Error message sanitization (no sensitive information leakage)
- Follow same security patterns as customer management integration
- Mock data generation prevents external API vulnerabilities

## Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15 App Router with Route Handlers
- TypeScript with strict typing for all interfaces
- React 19 hooks and patterns for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling with design system colors
- Error boundaries for robustness and graceful failure handling
- Follow established caching, error handling, and service layer patterns

## Integration Pattern Requirements

- Match existing widget styling and layout patterns
- Use same color coding system as customer management (green/yellow/red)
- Follow same input/button/error display patterns
- Implement same loading state and error handling UX
- Maintain consistent spacing, typography, and component structure

## Context Compression Goals

- Demonstrate automated pattern discovery across multiple components
- Show how to maintain consistency without manual pattern summarization
- Teach effective spec generation using existing codebase analysis
- Illustrate cohesive dashboard composition with multiple AI-generated widgets
- Use mock data to ensure reliable, predictable workshop outcomes
