# Customer Management Integration Requirements

## Business Context

- Build a complete customer management feature for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard
- Allow users to add new customers with comprehensive metadata to the system
- Provide customer data persistence and management capabilities
- Demonstrate multi-step AI orchestration for full-stack CRUD operations

## What is Customer Management?

**Customer management** involves storing and organizing customer information:

- Customer profiles with name, company, contact information, and business metrics
- Health scores, subscription details, and relationship status
- Searchable customer database for quick access and analysis
- Foundation for all other dashboard features and analytics

## Functional Requirements

### User Experience Flow

- Users should be able to navigate from the home screen to customer management
- Home screen should provide clear access point to customer management features
- Seamless transition between customer browsing (existing CustomerCard selection) and customer management (CRUD operations)
- Integration with existing customer display components and workflows

### API Layer

- Create Next.js API routes for customer CRUD operations:
  - `GET /api/customers` - List all customers with optional filtering
  - `POST /api/customers` - Add new customer with validation
  - `GET /api/customers/[id]` - Get specific customer details
  - `PUT /api/customers/[id]` - Update customer information
- Validate customer input data (name, email, company, health score)
- Sanitize responses and handle data validation errors
- Return consistent JSON response format with customer data and metadata

### Service Layer

- Create CustomerService class for business logic abstraction
- Implement in-memory storage with data persistence simulation
- Customer data validation and sanitization
- Pure function implementations for testability

### UI Components

- Build AddCustomerForm component for customer creation
- Form fields for name, email, company, health score, and subscription tier
- Input validation with real-time feedback
- Success/error states with proper user notifications
- CustomerList component to display existing customers with filtering

### Navigation and User Flow

- Add navigation from home screen to customer management functionality
- Provide clear entry point for users to access customer management features
- Include "Manage Customers" or "Customer Management" button/link on main dashboard
- Ensure smooth transition between home view and customer management view
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns with existing dashboard components

## Security Requirements

- Input validation to prevent injection attacks (name, email, company fields)
- Email format validation and sanitization
- Data sanitization before storage and display
- Error message sanitization (no sensitive information leakage)
- Rate limiting considerations for customer creation API routes

## Technical Constraints

- Next.js 15 App Router with Route Handlers for customer API endpoints
- TypeScript with strict typing for Customer interfaces and form data
- React 19 hooks and patterns for form management and state
- Tailwind CSS for styling with design system colors
- Error boundaries for robustness and graceful failure handling
- In-memory storage simulation (no external database required)
