# Predictive Alerts System Requirements

## Business Context

- Build an intelligent predictive alerts system for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard
- Provide proactive customer risk monitoring and early warning capabilities
- Demonstrate reactive and proactive AI features with real-time data monitoring
- Show advanced AI collaboration for complex rule design and system architecture

## Functional Requirements

### Alert Rules Engine

- Multi-tier alert priority system: High Priority (immediate action), Medium Priority (monitor closely)
- Rule-based triggering system with configurable thresholds and conditions
- Alert prioritization logic considering customer value (ARR) and workload balancing
- Cooldown periods to prevent alert spam and fatigue

### High Priority Alert Types

- **Payment Risk Alert**: Payment overdue >30 days OR health score drops >20 points in 7 days
- **Engagement Cliff Alert**: Login frequency drops >50% compared to 30-day average
- **Contract Expiration Risk**: Contract expires in <90 days AND health score <50

### Medium Priority Alert Types

- **Support Ticket Spike**: >3 support tickets in 7 days OR escalated ticket
- **Feature Adoption Stall**: No new feature usage in 30 days for growing accounts

### Data Monitoring System

- Real-time monitoring of customer health score changes and thresholds
- Login pattern analysis for gradual vs sudden engagement drops
- Payment timing and behavior change detection
- Support satisfaction trends and ticket escalation monitoring
- Feature usage depth and adoption pattern analysis

### Alert Generation and Management

- Pure function implementation in lib/alerts.ts for rule evaluation
- Deduplication logic to prevent duplicate alerts for same customer/issue
- Alert history tracking and audit trail for response effectiveness
- Business hours consideration for alert delivery timing

### User Interface Components

- Real-time alert display widget integrated into main dashboard
- Alert priority visualization with color coding (red/yellow/green)
- Alert detail panels with recommended actions and context
- Alert dismissal and action tracking interface
- Historical alerts view and analytics

## AI Collaboration Requirements

- Collaborative rule design sessions exploring edge cases and thresholds
- AI-assisted exploration of alert logic and business implications
- Request explanations of design decisions and trade-offs
- AI review of client-side security vulnerabilities
- Iterative testing scenarios and edge case identification

## Technical Architecture

### Rules Engine Implementation

- Pure functions for each alert rule type (testable and predictable)
- Main alertEngine function that evaluates all rules against customer data
- TypeScript interfaces for all alert types, customer data, and system responses
- Priority scoring algorithm with weighted factors (customer value, urgency, recency)

### Data Integration

- Integration with existing health score calculator and customer data
- Real-time data monitoring with efficient change detection
- Customer state tracking for trend analysis and pattern recognition
- External data source integration (payment, engagement, support metrics)

### Security Requirements

- Input validation for all customer data and rule parameters
- No sensitive customer data exposure in alert messages
- Rate limiting on alert generation to prevent system abuse
- Audit trail logging for all triggered alerts and user actions
- Client-side security review for alert logic and data handling

### Performance Requirements

- Real-time alert processing with minimal latency
- Efficient rule evaluation algorithms for hundreds of customers
- Optimized data queries and caching for monitoring systems
- Scalable architecture supporting growing customer base
- Resource usage monitoring and alerting system optimization

## Integration Requirements

- Seamless integration with existing CustomerSelector and dashboard widgets
- Consistent UI patterns and styling with other dashboard components
- Real-time updates when customer selection changes or data updates
- Alert state synchronization across multiple dashboard sessions
- Export capabilities for alert data and historical analysis

## Testing and Validation

- Comprehensive unit tests for all alert rules and logic functions
- Edge case testing for boundary conditions and data anomalies
- Realistic customer data scenario testing with various risk profiles
- Performance testing for real-time monitoring and alert generation
- Security testing for client-side vulnerabilities and data exposure

## Monitoring and Analytics

- Alert effectiveness tracking (correlation with actual customer outcomes)
- Alert fatigue monitoring and optimization recommendations
- System performance metrics and resource usage analytics
- User engagement with alerts and action completion rates
- A/B testing framework for rule optimization and threshold tuning
