# Feature: CustomerSelector

## Context

- **Purpose and role in the application**: The CustomerSelector is the primary interface component for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard that enables users to find and select individual customers for detailed analysis. It serves as the entry point for customer-focused workflows.
- **How it fits into the larger system**: Acts as the main navigation component that feeds customer selections to other dashboard components like customer cards, health metrics, market intelligence, and predictive alerts. The selected customer becomes the context for all other dashboard features.
- **Who will use it and when**: Business analysts, customer success managers, and sales teams will use this component when they need to analyze specific customer data, investigate health trends, or respond to alerts about particular customers.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- Display a searchable and filterable list of customers with essential information
- Support real-time search by customer name and company name
- Provide visual feedback for currently selected customer
- Handle customer selection events and persist selection state
- Support efficient rendering and interaction with 100+ customer records
- Display customer health scores with appropriate visual indicators
- Enable quick customer switching without page reloads

### User Interface Requirements

- Clean, scannable list layout with customer cards
- Prominent search input field with placeholder text
- Visual distinction for selected customer (highlight, border, or background change)
- Health score visualization using color coding or progress indicators
- Responsive design that works on desktop and tablet viewports
- Loading states for data fetching
- Empty states when no customers match search criteria

### Data Requirements

- Customer ID (unique identifier for selection persistence)
- Customer name (primary display text)
- Company name (secondary display text and searchable field)
- Health score (numeric value 0-100 with visual representation)
- Selection state (boolean indicating current selection)
- Search query state (string for filtering customers)

### Integration Requirements

- Accept customer data array as props from parent component
- Emit selection events to notify parent components of customer changes
- Support external selection changes (controlled component pattern)
- Integrate with global state management for selection persistence
- Work with existing dashboard routing and navigation patterns

## Constraints

### Technical Stack and Frameworks

- Built with Next.js 15 App Router and React 19
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
- Use React Server Components where appropriate for performance

### Performance Requirements

- Initial render within 200ms for 100+ customers
- Search filtering response time under 50ms
- Smooth scrolling and interaction without janky animations
- Efficient re-rendering using React optimization patterns (memo, useMemo, useCallback)
- Lazy loading or virtualization if customer count exceeds 500 items

### Design Constraints

- Desktop breakpoint: minimum 768px width for full layout
- Tablet breakpoint: 640px-767px with adjusted spacing
- Mobile breakpoint: below 640px with stacked layout
- Maximum component height: 80vh with internal scrolling
- Customer card minimum touch target: 44px height for accessibility
- Search input minimum height: 40px with focus indicators

### File Structure and Naming Conventions

- Main component: `components/CustomerSelector.tsx`
- Types: `types/customer.ts` for Customer interface
- Hooks: `hooks/useCustomerSelection.ts` for selection logic
- Utilities: `utils/customerSearch.ts` for search/filter functions
- Tests: `__tests__/CustomerSelector.test.tsx`

### Props Interface and TypeScript Definitions

```typescript
interface Customer {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  company: string;
  healthScore: number;
}

interface CustomerSelectorProps {
  customers: Customer[];
  selectedCustomerId?: string;
  onCustomerSelect: (customerId: string) => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
  className?: string;
}
```

### Security Considerations

- Sanitize search input to prevent XSS attacks
- Validate customer ID format before selection events
- Escape customer name and company display text
- Implement proper error boundaries for graceful failure handling

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Users can search customers by typing in the search field, with results filtering in real-time as they type
- [ ] **Customer Selection**: Clicking on a customer card selects that customer and provides clear visual feedback (highlighting, border change, etc.)
- [ ] **Selection Persistence**: Selected customer remains highlighted and accessible even after other dashboard interactions
- [ ] **Performance with Scale**: Component renders and searches efficiently with 100+ customers without performance degradation
- [ ] **Health Score Display**: Customer health scores are displayed with appropriate visual indicators (colors, progress bars, or numeric badges)
- [ ] **Responsive Design**: Component adapts appropriately to desktop and tablet screen sizes with proper touch targets
- [ ] **Loading States**: Shows appropriate loading indicators while customer data is being fetched
- [ ] **Empty States**: Displays helpful message when no customers match search criteria
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Component is keyboard navigable with proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles missing customer data, invalid selections, and network errors
- [ ] **TypeScript Integration**: All props, state, and event handlers are properly typed with comprehensive interfaces
- [ ] **Integration Points**: Successfully integrates with parent dashboard components and maintains selection state across the application
