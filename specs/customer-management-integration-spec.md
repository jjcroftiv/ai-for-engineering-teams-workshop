## Feature: Customer Management Integration

### Context

- Complete customer management feature for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard
- Full-stack CRUD operations for customer data persistence and management
- Foundation system that supports all other dashboard features and analytics
- Used by business analysts, customer success managers, and sales teams for customer data entry and management
- Demonstrates multi-layer architecture with API, service, and UI separation

### Requirements

- **Functional requirements:**
  - Create comprehensive API layer with Next.js Route Handlers for customer CRUD operations
  - Implement CustomerService class for business logic abstraction and data management
  - Build AddCustomerForm component for customer creation with real-time validation
  - Create CustomerList component to display and filter existing customers
  - Support customer profiles with name, company, contact information, and business metrics
  - Enable customer data persistence with in-memory storage simulation
  - Provide searchable customer database for quick access and analysis

- **User interface requirements:**
  - AddCustomerForm with fields for name, email, company, health score, and subscription tier
  - Real-time input validation with immediate feedback
  - Success and error states with proper user notifications
  - CustomerList with filtering and search capabilities
  - Responsive design that works across all device sizes
  - Loading states during API operations
  - Error boundaries for graceful failure handling

- **Data requirements:**
  - Customer interface with comprehensive metadata fields
  - Health scores, subscription details, and relationship status
  - Email format validation and data sanitization
  - Consistent JSON response format with customer data and metadata
  - Pure function implementations for testability

- **Integration requirements:**
  - API routes: GET /api/customers, POST /api/customers, GET /api/customers/[id], PUT /api/customers/[id]
  - Integration between UI components and API layer through service abstraction
  - Error handling and validation at all layers
  - Type safety throughout the entire stack with TypeScript

### Constraints

- **Technical stack:** Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Performance requirements:**
  - Customer list should render efficiently with 100+ customers
  - Form validation should respond within 100ms
  - API responses should complete within 500ms
- **Design constraints:**
  - Responsive breakpoints: mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), desktop (1024px+)
  - Follow existing design system colors and patterns
  - Consistent styling with existing dashboard components
- **File structure:**
  - API routes in `app/src/app/api/customers/` directory
  - Service layer in `app/src/services/CustomerService.ts`
  - Components in `app/src/components/AddCustomerForm.tsx` and `CustomerList.tsx`
  - Types in existing Customer interface with extensions
- **Props interface:**
  - AddCustomerForm with onSuccess callback and loading state management
  - CustomerList with filtering props and customer selection handlers
  - TypeScript definitions for all API request/response types
- **Security considerations:**
  - Input validation to prevent injection attacks on all text fields
  - Email format validation and sanitization
  - Data sanitization before storage and display
  - Error message sanitization with no sensitive information leakage
  - Rate limiting considerations for customer creation endpoints

- [ ] Loading states provide feedback during API operations
- [ ] Responsive design works across all specified breakpoints
- [ ] Form submissions create customers successfully via API
- [ ] Customer data persists and retrieves correctly through service layer
- [ ] All validation prevents invalid data from entering the system
- [ ] Integration testing verifies end-to-end workflows function correctly
