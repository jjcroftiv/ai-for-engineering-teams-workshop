## Feature: LoadingButton Component

### Context
- Enhanced button component with loading state for async operations
- Used throughout the Customer Intelligence Dashboard for form submissions and API calls
- Provides visual feedback during network requests and data processing
- Primary users are developers implementing forms and interactive features that require async operations

### Requirements
- **Functional requirements:**
  - Extend base button functionality with loading state management
  - Display spinner animation during loading state
  - Disable button interaction while loading
  - Support all button variants (primary, secondary, danger) with loading state
  - Handle loading state transitions smoothly
- **User interface requirements:**
  - Animated spinner icon that replaces or accompanies button text
  - Consistent button dimensions during loading state (no layout shift)
  - Accessible loading indication for screen readers
  - Smooth transitions between normal and loading states
- **Data requirements:**
  - Accept `isLoading` boolean prop to control loading state
  - Support `loadingText` prop for custom loading message
  - Maintain all existing Button component props
  - TypeScript interface extending base Button props
- **Integration requirements:**
  - Compose with existing Button component or extend its functionality
  - Compatible with form libraries and async operation patterns
  - Export as named component following code quality standards

### Constraints
- Technical stack and frameworks (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- Performance requirements (smooth animations, no layout shift during loading)
- Design constraints (consistent with dashboard design system, responsive)
- File structure: Component in `src/components/LoadingButton.tsx`
- Props interface must extend base Button interface with loading-specific props
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance with proper ARIA labels for loading state
- Use semantic JSX element names that describe purpose, not appearance

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Displays spinner animation when `isLoading` is true
- [ ] Disables button interaction during loading state
- [ ] Maintains consistent button dimensions (no layout shift)
- [ ] Supports custom loading text via `loadingText` prop
- [ ] Provides accessible loading indication with ARIA attributes
- [ ] Works with all button variants and sizes
- [ ] Follows React-specific quality rules (named exports, proper TypeScript interfaces)
- [ ] Uses descriptive variable and function names
- [ ] Includes proper loading and error state handling
