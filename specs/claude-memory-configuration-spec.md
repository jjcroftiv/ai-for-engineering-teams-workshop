# Spec Template for Workshop

## Feature: Claude Memory Configuration for Workshop Context

### Context

- Purpose and role in the application: Enable Claude to remember workshop-specific patterns, file organization, and technical stack preferences across conversations
- How it fits into the larger system: Provides persistent context that improves Claude's consistency in following workshop conventions and file organization
- Who will use it and when: Workshop participants will configure Claude's memory at the beginning of each exercise session to maintain context consistency

### Requirements

- Functional requirements (what it must do):
  - Configure memory to remember that specs generated using @templates/spec-template.md should be stored in @specs/
  - Store workshop technical stack information (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
  - Validate that memory configuration is working correctly
  - Demonstrate memory retention across different requests
- User interface requirements: Command-line memory configuration using `/memory` commands
- Data requirements: Store file organization patterns and technical stack preferences
- Integration requirements: Memory system must persist across Claude conversations and integrate with existing workshop workflow

### Constraints

- Technical stack and frameworks (Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS): Must be stored in memory for consistent reference
- Performance requirements (load times, rendering thresholds): Memory lookup should not add noticeable latency to responses
- Design constraints (responsive breakpoints, component size limits): N/A for memory configuration
- File structure and naming conventions:
  - Specs must be stored in /specs/ directory
  - Follow existing naming conventions (kebab-case with -spec.md suffix)
- Props interface and TypeScript definitions: N/A for memory configuration
- Security considerations: Memory should not store sensitive information, only workflow and organizational patterns

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory successfully configured with file organization patterns
- [ ] Memory successfully configured with technical stack information
- [ ] Memory validation confirms information is retained
- [ ] Test scenario demonstrates correct file placement behavior
- [ ] Workshop participants can successfully replicate the memory configuration process
- [ ] Documentation provides clear examples of memory commands and expected behavior
