## Feature: CustomerCard Enhancement - Selection Functionality

### Context

- Enhance existing CustomerCard component to support user selection interaction
- Critical for customer management workflows where users need to select specific customers
- Foundation for multi-customer operations and detailed customer views
- Used by business analysts, customer success managers, and sales teams during customer review sessions

### Requirements

- **Functional requirements:**
  - Add click handling to existing CustomerCard without breaking current functionality
  - Implement visual selection state with clear highlighting when card is selected
  - Support single selection model (only one customer selected at a time)
  - Maintain all existing CustomerCard features (health score visualization, company display)
  - Provide callback mechanism for parent components to handle selection events
  - Preserve responsive design and accessibility features

- **User interface requirements:**
  - Selected state shows distinct visual feedback (border highlight or background change)
  - Hover states remain functional and don't conflict with selection styling
  - Smooth transitions for selection state changes
  - Clear visual hierarchy between normal, hover, and selected states
  - Maintain readability of text content in all states

- **Data requirements:**
  - Accept isSelected boolean prop to control selection state externally
  - Pass customer object in onClick callback for parent state management
  - Maintain existing Customer interface compatibility
  - Support optional selection without breaking non-interactive usage

- **Integration requirements:**
  - Backward compatible with existing CustomerCard implementations
  - Works seamlessly with parent components managing selection state
  - Integrates with keyboard navigation for accessibility
  - Compatible with existing grid layouts and responsive breakpoints

### Constraints

- **Technical stack:** Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Performance requirements:**
  - Selection state changes should be instantaneous (< 50ms)
  - No performance degradation to existing rendering performance
  - Smooth animations for visual state transitions
- **Design constraints:**
  - Maintain existing responsive breakpoints and sizing
  - Selection styling should not interfere with health score color coding
  - Visual feedback must meet accessibility contrast requirements
- **File structure:** Enhance existing `app/src/components/CustomerCard.tsx`
- **Props interface:**
  - Add optional `isSelected?: boolean` prop
  - Add optional `onClick?: (customer: Customer) => void` callback
  - Maintain all existing props for backward compatibility
  - TypeScript definitions for all new props with proper typing
- **Security considerations:**
  - Validate customer data before processing selection events
  - Sanitize any user interactions to prevent XSS

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CustomerCard accepts isSelected prop and shows visual selection state

- [ ] Selection state transitions are smooth and performant
- [ ] Backward compatibility maintained for existing implementations
- [ ] Keyboard accessibility works for selection (Enter key support)
- [ ] Visual feedback meets accessibility contrast requirements
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces properly define all selection-related props
- [ ] Component works in both interactive and non-interactive modes
