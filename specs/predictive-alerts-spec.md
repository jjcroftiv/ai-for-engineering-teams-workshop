# Spec: Predictive Alerts System

## Feature: Intelligent Customer Risk Monitoring and Alert Generation

### Context

- **Purpose**: Provide proactive customer risk monitoring with intelligent alert generation and prioritization
- **Role in application**: Real-time monitoring and early warning system for the Customer Intelligence Dashboard
- **System integration**: Works with existing health score calculator, customer data, and dashboard components to provide continuous risk assessment
- **Users**: Customer success managers, account managers, and support teams who need to proactively address customer risks before they escalate

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

- **Multi-tier alert system**: High priority (immediate action) and Medium priority (monitor closely) with distinct visual indicators
- **Rule-based triggering**: Configurable thresholds and conditions with intelligent cooldown periods to prevent alert fatigue
- **Real-time monitoring**: Continuous evaluation of customer metrics with efficient change detection algorithms
- **Alert deduplication**: Prevents duplicate alerts for the same customer/issue within configurable time windows
- **Historical tracking**: Complete audit trail of triggered alerts and user actions for effectiveness analysis

#### Alert Rule Specifications

- **Payment Risk Alert (High Priority)**: Payment overdue >30 days OR health score drops >20 points in 7 days
- **Engagement Cliff Alert (High Priority)**: Login frequency drops >50% compared to 30-day rolling average
- **Contract Expiration Risk (High Priority)**: Contract expires in <90 days AND health score <50
- **Support Ticket Spike (Medium Priority)**: >3 support tickets in 7 days OR escalated ticket received
- **Feature Adoption Stall (Medium Priority)**: No new feature usage in 30 days for growing accounts (ARR >$50k)

#### User Interface Requirements

- **Real-time alert display**: Live updating widget showing active alerts with priority-based ordering
- **Alert detail panels**: Expandable views with context, recommended actions, and customer history
- **Visual priority system**: Color-coded alerts (red for high, yellow for medium) with consistent iconography
- **Action tracking**: Alert dismissal, snooze, and resolution tracking with timestamped audit trail
- **Historical view**: Searchable archive of past alerts with filtering by customer, type, and date range

#### Data Integration Requirements

- **Health score integration**: Real-time monitoring of health score changes and trend analysis
- **Customer state tracking**: Continuous monitoring of payment, engagement, contract, and support metrics
- **Change detection**: Efficient algorithms to identify significant metric changes and patterns
- **External data sources**: Integration with payment systems, engagement tracking, and support ticketing

### Constraints

#### Technical Stack and Frameworks

- **Next.js 15 App Router**: For real-time data monitoring and alert processing
- **React 19**: Component architecture with real-time updates and state management
- **TypeScript strict mode**: All interfaces, functions, and alert logic strongly typed
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling consistent with existing dashboard components and alert priority colors

#### Performance Requirements

- **Real-time processing**: Alert evaluation must complete within 500ms for single customer assessment
- **Batch processing**: Evaluate alerts for 100+ customers within 5 seconds for dashboard updates
- **Memory efficiency**: Minimal memory footprint for continuous background monitoring
- **Change detection**: Efficient algorithms to identify metric changes without full re-evaluation

#### Design Constraints

- **Responsive breakpoints**: Alert display adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
- **Component integration**: Seamless integration with existing dashboard layout and CustomerSelector
- **Visual hierarchy**: Clear priority distinction using established color scheme (red/yellow/green)
- **Accessibility compliance**: WCAG 2.1 AA standards with screen reader support and keyboard navigation

#### File Structure and Naming Conventions

```
app/src/lib/alerts.ts                    # Alert rules engine and evaluation logic
app/src/lib/__tests__/alerts.test.ts     # Comprehensive alert engine tests
app/src/components/PredictiveAlertsWidget.tsx  # Main alert display component
app/src/components/AlertDetailPanel.tsx  # Individual alert detail view
app/src/types/alerts.ts                  # TypeScript interfaces for alert system
app/src/data/mock-alert-data.ts          # Mock alert scenarios for testing
```

#### Props Interface and TypeScript Definitions

```typescript
interface Alert {
  id: string;
  customerId: string;
  type: AlertType;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  triggeredAt: Date;
  cooldownUntil?: Date;
  dismissedAt?: Date;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
}

interface AlertRule {
  type: AlertType;
  priority: 'high' | 'medium';
  evaluate: (customer: CustomerHealthData, history?: CustomerHistory) => AlertResult;
  cooldownPeriod: number; // minutes
  description: string;
}

interface AlertEngine {
  evaluateCustomer: (customer: CustomerHealthData) => Alert[];
  evaluateAllCustomers: (customers: CustomerHealthData[]) => Alert[];
  getActiveAlerts: () => Alert[];
  dismissAlert: (alertId: string) => void;
  resolveAlert: (alertId: string) => void;
}
```

#### Security Considerations

- **Input validation**: All customer data inputs validated and sanitized before rule evaluation
- **Data sanitization**: No sensitive customer information exposed in alert messages or logs
- **Rate limiting**: Alert generation rate limiting to prevent system abuse and excessive notifications
- **Audit trail**: Complete logging of all triggered alerts and user actions for security review
- **Client-side security**: Review of alert logic for potential vulnerabilities and data exposure

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Alert rule accuracy**: All alert rules trigger correctly based on defined thresholds with <1% false positive rate
- [ ] **Real-time monitoring**: Alert evaluation completes within 500ms for individual customers and 5 seconds for batch processing
- [ ] **Priority classification**: High and medium priority alerts correctly classified and visually distinguished
- [ ] **Deduplication logic**: No duplicate alerts generated for same customer/issue within cooldown periods
- [ ] **UI integration**: Alert widget integrates seamlessly with existing dashboard layout and responsive design
- [ ] **Performance targets**: System handles 100+ customers with continuous monitoring without performance degradation
- [ ] **Security validation**: Client-side alert logic reviewed and validated with no sensitive data exposure
- [ ] **Accessibility compliance**: Alert displays meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards with proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- [ ] **Historical tracking**: Complete audit trail maintained for all alerts with searchable history interface
- [ ] **Edge case handling**: System gracefully handles missing data, invalid inputs, and boundary conditions
- [ ] **Alert fatigue prevention**: Cooldown periods and deduplication logic prevent excessive notifications
- [ ] **Action tracking**: User actions (dismiss, snooze, resolve) properly tracked with timestamps and audit trail
- [ ] **Dashboard integration**: Real-time updates when customer selection changes with state synchronization
- [ ] **Test coverage**: Minimum 95% code coverage with comprehensive edge case and security testing
- [ ] **Documentation**: All alert rules and logic documented with clear business rationale and maintenance guidelines
