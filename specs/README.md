# Specifications Directory

This directory is where you should save all the specifications created during the workshop.

## Purpose
- Store specifications generated using Claude and the template from `@templates/spec-template.md`
- Keep all workshop specs organized in one location
- Reference during implementation exercises

## How to Use
1. When prompted to create a specification with Claude, use: `@templates/spec-template.md`
2. Save the generated specification in this directory
3. Use descriptive filenames like `customer-selector-spec.md`, `customer-card-spec.md`

## Workshop Exercises
During the "Thinking in Specs" section, you'll create:
- CustomerSelector specification (using `@requirements/customer-selector.md`)
- Additional component specifications as the workshop progresses

## File Naming Convention
Use kebab-case for specification files:
- `customer-selector-spec.md`
- `customer-card-spec.md`
- `domain-health-widget-spec.md`

Each specification should follow the template structure with Context, Requirements, Constraints, and Acceptance Criteria sections.
